# MultiShiftRegister

MultiShiftRegister (MSR) is an Arduino library for easily interfacing with multiple daisy-chained SIPO (Serial In, Parallel Out) latching shift registers (such as the 74HC595) to greatly expand the number of binary outputs available to the developer.

## Requirements

MSR expects the shift registers to use a CLOCK pin, a LATCH pin, and a DATA pin to control input.

## Installation

Copy all the files in this repository into a MultiShiftRegister folder in your libraries folder found in the root of your sketchbook folder.

## Use

```
#include <MultiShiftRegister.h>

int latchPin  = 8;
int clockPin = 12;
int dataPin = 11;

# How many 8 bit shift registers we're talking to.
# Two 8 bit registers can host 16 individuallly
# addressable binary outputs.
int numberOfRegisters = 2;

# Setup group of shift registers and name it `msr`.
# All outputs are initialized to low/off.
MultiShiftRegister msr (numberOfRegisters , latchPin, clockPin, dataPin); 

void setup() {
  pinMode(latchPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(clockPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(dataPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  # Prepare to turn on pin 5.
  # Pin 5 is still low/off.
  msr.set(5);

  # Shift data out, with appropriate latches.
  # Pin 5 is now high/on.
  msr.shift();

  delay(1000);

  # Turn pin 5 back off.
  msr.clear(5);
  msr.shift();

  delay(1000);

  # Turn pin 12 (4th output on the second shift register).
  # on and off again.
  msr.set(12); 
  msr.shift(); 
  delay(1000);
  msr.clear(12); 
  msr.shift(); 

  delay(1000);

  # This set and shift business is getting repetitive.
  # Let's do it in one line instead.
  msr.set_shift(14);
  delay(1000);
  msr.clear_shift(14);

  delay(1000);

  # But wait, this is inefficient. It doesn't actually turn
  # outputs 5 and 12 on simultaneously. There a very tiny delay
  # as it shifts output 5 before setting output 12. This may or
  # may not be a problem, depending on your application.
  msr.set_shift(5);
  msr.set_shift(12);
  delay(1000);
  msr.clear_shift(5);
  msr.clear_shift(12);

  delay(1000);

  # So, consider doing this to prepare both outputs before shifting them.
  msr.set(5);
  msr.set(12);
  msr.shift();
  delay(1000);
  msr.clear(5);
  msr.clear(12);
  msr.shift();

  delay(1000);
}
```
